        </div>


        <div class="mb2">
            <h3 class="text-left">Summary:</h3>


            <p>In early 2015, the Marketing Communications
            team at Inkling was thinking deeply about questions of brand and
            identity. We were new to the B2B enterprise business space, and our
            culture was still deeply influenced by our roots in publishing and
            academia. In short, we were a bunch of nerds passionate about
            sharing knowledge and cultivating curiosity—and we wanted to keep
            it that way.</p>


            <p>The team was also new to video, and eager to
            explore its storytelling potential. We decided to test the waters
            with a video on Inkling culture to see how far we could go with
            just our in-house skills.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3 class="text-left">Considerations:</h3>


            <ul>
                <li>Everything from shooting to sound to
                production had to be done in-house</li>


                <li>I would be doing most of those things
                for the first time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="content-extra-large bg-white">
        <h3 class="text-left">Process:</h3>


        <p><b>Step 1: Focus and Strategy</b><br>
        We realized early on that we needed to narrow the focus of this video
        in order to be successful. So we turned our attention inward—our goal
        was to give a glimpse into Inkling culture through the eyes of the
        Marketing Team.</p>


        <p class=" mb2">As we watched other B2B culture videos for
        inspiration, we found that the most compelling ones used a combination
        of interviews along with shots of office action. We didn’t need to look
        far for our own subjects; unsurprisingly, Marketing was teaming with
        charming brand advocates.</p>

        <hr class="mb2">


        <p><b>Step 2: Finding the Story</b><br>
        We looked to the Inkling brand pillars to help shape the video theme:
        Curiosity, Optimism, Empowerment, and Delight. Together these pillars
        dictated the tone of the video, and Curiosity in particular helped
        shape our interview questions. I was most interested in the idea that
        curiosity is what binds us together as Inkblots, and what drives us to
        build the best possible products for our customers. We drafted a series
        of leading questions and let the spontaneity of our interviews do the
        rest.</p>

        <p><b>Step 3: The Nitty-Gritty</b><br>
        What does it take to direct, shoot, and record an in-house video
        interview?</p>


        <ul>
            <li>At least one video-friendly DSLR, two to get
            an alternate close-up shot</li>


            <li>Audio recorder and sound proofing*</li>


            <li>Natural light plus additional standing
            lights</li>


            <li>Reflector panels**</li>
        </ul>

                <p><b>Step 4: Assembly</b><br>
                You never know quite what you’re going to get with interview
                footage—thankfully ours was full of natural, genuine moments
                that provided the building blocks of the story. I shot b-roll
                in and around the office to fill in the gaps and visually
                connect the scenes. For music, we called upon a talented
                Inkblot Josh Maccombs who delivered an upbeat track that set
                the mood perfectly.</p>

            <ul>
                <li id="audio"><b>Audio quality is key</b>,
                and very difficult to achieve without the right setup! We
                treated this as a learning experience and chose not to
                re-record despite our imperfect audio</li>


                <li>This was a great step towards building a
                <b>culture of video</b> at Inkling</li>
